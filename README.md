JavaScript Fundamentals
=======================

Data Types
----------
- _Number_ - There is only one number type in JavaScript. It's a 64-bit floating point number.
- _String_ - Strings can be enclosed using single quotes ' or double quotes ". The escape character is a backslash (\\). Strings are immutable.

Closure
-------
- inner functions get access to the parameters and variables of the functions they are defined within (with the exception of this and arguments). [1]
